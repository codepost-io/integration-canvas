# Integrating with Canvas

This repository contains short utility scripts that make it easy to connect codePost with Canvas.

A typical lead instructor will usually do something like the following every week:

- Import student submissions into codePost from Canvas
- Grade and review student submissions in codePost
- Export grades from codePost back to Canvas in a csv

## Import submissions into codePost from Canvas

- If you have a Canvas Admin API key, go [here]().
- If not, go [here]().

> To get a Canvas API Key, either ask your schoolâ€™s Canvas Admin or login to Canvas and go to `Account -> Settings -> New Access Token`

## Exporting grades from codePost to Canvas

Once all submissions for an assignment are graded on codePost, go to `codepost.io/admin -> Assignments -> Download Grades`.

Format the csv as necessary and upload to Canvas by going to your Canvas Instance -> Course -> Grades -> Import.
